Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!



#### What have you done for your project so far?

Currently I am able to draw a chessboard with pieces on it, and the pieces are able to determine what moves they can make.
The king can also determine whether or not it is in check.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not programmed moves for the pieces or a way to detect checkmate yet. I also need to program captures, and if I have time I would like to make en passant possible as well.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I have not encountered any problems yet.
