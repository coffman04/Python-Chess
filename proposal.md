# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Maze Escape 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

An adventure game / visual novel that starts the player in the middle of a maze and has them walk around trying to escape, coded using RenPy.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

This project will operate like a choose your own adventure book / visual novel. The core gameplay loop will be the player entering an action, which the program will respond to. Each action will influence something, and the program will be able to detect invalid commands. I am not sure what theme I would like to use for this project yet, but I will be implementing sort of theming in the final project. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome for this project would be having a visual novel without bugs, that allows the user to move through the maze either forwards, backwards, or left and right. There will also be keys to unlock doors in the maze.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I would like to add weapons and enemies into the game as well, with certain weapons being needed to defeat certain enemies. If doing this, I would also implement a inventory management system to make the player choose which weapons/keys to keep.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to accomplish an ending scene that takes place on a grid where the player must outmaneuver an enemy. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

For this project, I will need to learn how to use RenPy. This will probably require some research into the RenPy docs as well as research on the internet. I will also probably need to learn about classes in Python. Since I am creating a maze, it would probably be helpful to have classes for rooms, as well as keys. The final thing I would need to research, if I am trying to complete the best outcome for my project, would be simple but functional artificial intelligence to get the enemy to move correctly on the grid.
