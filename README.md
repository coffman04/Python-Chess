# comments on how the project went
I definitely learned a lot about the approach I want to make to coding in this project. When I started coding chess, I began by creating classes, something that I had learned about in high school Java classes. I would do this again if I had to start from scratch, but I think I would change some of the class methods I made, to make it easier to code later elements, such as en passant and checkmate, where I ultimately got stuck. I think I would take some time to plan out more of what I wanted to do, so that I would know everything I wanted to code before hand, and how to code earlier functions so that they would provide outputs that I needed for later functions.
I think some positive takeaways from this project were becoming more skilled at reading documentation, and getting much better at debugging code. I often found myself running code, looking at where it broke, then fixing whatever syntax error or logic error I had made. In regards to documentation it was helpful to learn how Python classes differed from those in Java. It was also very useful when I was leaning Tkinter, as I didn't really understand how to make a canvas at first, and how the mainloop,, bind, and event functions worked.
